# KNN_IrisDataset

KNN falls in the supervised learning family of algorithms. Informally, this means that we are given a labelled dataset consiting of training observations (x, y) and would like to capture the relationship between x and y. More formally, our goal is to learn a function h: X?Y so that given an unseen observation x, h(x) can confidently predict the corresponding output y.

In this module we will explore the inner workings of KNN, choosing the optimal K values and using KNN from scikit-learn.

Dataset
The data set weâ€™ll be using is the Iris Flower Dataset which was first introduced in 1936 by the famous statistician Ronald Fisher and consists of 50 observations from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.

Train the KNN algorithm to be able to distinguish the species from one another given the measurements of the 4 features.
